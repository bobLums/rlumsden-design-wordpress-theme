                        <p class="big-p">My name is Robert (Bob) Lumsden and I am web designer, graphic designer and wordpress developer 
                        with six years of experience working in design. I have worked both as an in-house designer at a tech start-up 
                        and freelancer. I specialize in working with creators, sole proprietors and small businesses. My background is 
                        in studio art, and I completed my undergraduate work at Bard College in 2009. After working at the Brooklyn 
                        Children's Museum for four years as an after-school educator, I did my graduate work in video game design and 
                        development at R.I.T. I am passionate about gameful design and interactive art, and am excited to bring these 
                        related practices into my design practice.
                        <br><br>I currently live and work in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
